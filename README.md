# track-amazon-prices-script

A simple Python application that tracks the current price of a product on Amazon. The script executes in two steps. First, it uses modules like BeautifulSoup and requests for parsing and fetching data from a web page. Secondly, it establishes connection with the Gmail server, then takes in the data, first in form of sender and receiver emails and then by getting the message strings.

Apart from requests and BeautifulSoup, the script uses modules such as regular expression, decimal, smtplib and time.
